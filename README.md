MTFactorialTask
====================

Simple app that solves factorial related problem (written in Objective-C).

Assignment
====================

Find most biggest n which n! is not greater than m ( 0 <= m <= unsigned long max)

### Required

- Please do it in Objective-C
- You can use just unsigned long type
- Calculate numbers in Background Thread.
- Use Recursive Function Call to calculate numbers.
- Update every factorial number on the screen after calculation (one by one).

### Good To Have

- Show Numbers on Tableview or Gridview.
- Take care about efficiancy & performance

### Input/Output Samples

- if m = **0**
<br>result : 


- if m = **1**
<br>result :

>1 (1! = 1)


- if m = **2**
<br>result : 

>1 (1! = 1)
<br>
>2 (2! = 2)


- if m = **3**
<br>result : 

>1 (1! = 1)
<br>
>2 (2! = 2)


- if m = **5**
<br>result : 

>1 (1! = 1)
<br>
>2 (2! = 2)


- if m = **7** or **23**
<br>result : 

>1 (1! = 1)
<br>
>2 (2! = 2)
<br>
>3 (3! = 6)


- if m = **24**
<br>result : 

>1 (1! = 1)
<br>
>2 (2! = 2)
<br>
>3 (3! = 6)
<br>
>4 (4! = 24)

- if m = **1000** or **3456**
<br>result : 

>1 (1! = 1)
<br>
>2 (2! = 2)
<br>
>3 (3! = 6)
<br>
>4 (4! = 24)
<br>
>5 (5! = 120)
<br>
>6 (6! = 720)
